            <h4>Group 8: John Russell, Frank Duffy, Guy Nasser Bssoume, and Jenna Murphy</h4>
            <p>For Project 2 our group has created an interactive dashboard built with Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and a SQLite database.</p>

              <p>We have utilized Minneapolis Police Use of Force <a href="https://opendata.minneapolismn.gov/datasets/police-use-of-force/explore" target="_blank">data</a> which features over 33,000 records. Our dashboard filters the data by Minneapolis Neighborhood through a dropdown menu featured above. Three charts have been created to display the top 10 most common uses of forces, the top 10 most common problems that led to police use of force, and police use of force incidents over the years, spanning from January 2008 to July 2021.</p>
              
              <p>Please take a moment to explore the data below.</p>
